The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines: <strong>Node Representation</strong>: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value. <strong>Parentheses for Children</strong>: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically: <strong>Omitting Empty Parentheses</strong>: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., <code>()</code>) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained. In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately."

These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do. In other words: We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

A <strong>skiplist</strong> is a data structure that takes <code>O(log(n))</code> time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists. For example, we have a Skiplist containing <code>[30,40,50,60,70,90]</code> and we want to add <code>80</code> and <code>45</code> into it. The Skiplist works this way: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/27/1506_skiplist.gif\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 173px;\"><br>\n<small>Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skip_list_add_element-en.gif\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\">Wikimedia Commons</a></small> You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than <code>O(n)</code>.
