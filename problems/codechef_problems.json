An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable.\nThere are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable.\nIn this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations.

But they have some restrictions in the way they can move and meet:\nA step is defined as moving to an adjacent cell from the current cell that the person is in. So in a single step, if a person is at (X,Y)(X, Y)(X,Y) they may move to any one of the following cells, provided that they are inside the grid's boundaries - (X+1,Y)(X + 1, Y)(X+1,Y), (X,Y+1)(X, Y + 1)(X,Y+1), (X−1,Y)(X - 1, Y)(X−1,Y), (X,Y−1)(X, Y - 1)(X,Y−1).\nA move for Alice is defined to be exactly XXX steps. And a move for Bob is defined to be exactly YYY steps.\nThey can only meet at the common cell after Alice has just completed her move i.e. they should not meet in the middle of anyone's move or at the end of Bob's move.
